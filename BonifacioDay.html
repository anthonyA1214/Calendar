<td><font face="Bahnschrift Light" color="white">Bonifacio Day is a national holiday in the Philippines, commemorating Andr√©s Bonifacio, one of the country's national heroes. He was the founder and eventual Supremo of the Katipunan, a secret society that triggered the Philippine Revolution of 1896 against the Spanish Empire. It is celebrated every November 30, the birth anniversary of Bonifacio. It also coincides with the feast day of Saint Andrew the Apostle, from whom Bonifacio's given name was derived, as he was born on such day.</font><br>
