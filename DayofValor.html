<td><font face="Bahnschrift Light" color="white">The Day of Valor, officially known as Araw ng Kagitingan, is a national observance in the Philippines which commemorates the fall of Bataan to Japanese troops during World War II. The day is officially celebrated every April 9, the start of the Bataan Death March, although the date was moved on several occasions to avoid it from coinciding with the observance of the Holy Week in the country, especially the Easter Triduum and Easter Sunday, such as in 2009 and 2023.<br>
<br>
Due to Bataan's significance in World War II, the holiday was officially known as Bataan Day or Corregidor Day prior to the 2000s and still be used by others. In the United States, the holiday is celebrated in Maywood, Illinois, where it is referred to by its old name.</font><br>
