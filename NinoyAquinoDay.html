<td><font face="Bahnschrift Light" color="white">Ninoy Aquino Day is a national non-working holiday in the Philippines observed annually on August 21 commemorating the assassination of former Senator Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino, Jr. was the husband of Corazon Aquino, who later became 11th Philippine President. His assassination led to the downfall of the 10th president of the Philippines, Ferdinand Marcos, on February 25, 1986, through the People Power Revolution. Since 2004, a commemoration ceremony is traditionally held that was attended by presidents Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, Fidel V. Ramos and Benigno Aquino III.<br>
<br>
Unlike other dates reserved for national heroes of the Philippines (like Bonifacio Day, Rizal Day, Araw ng Kagitingan, and National Heroes Day), the date is not a "regular holiday" (double pay for working nationals) but only a "special non-working holiday" (premium of thirty-percent for working nationals).</font><br>
